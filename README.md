# DigitalFilmArchiveCpp
A digital film archive, written in C++, with a selection of Tarantino movies. 
Based on the SGG library: https://cgaueb.github.io/sgg/index.html

This project may be expanded by adding movies at the (SolutionFolder)/bin/assets folder. In this repository, the basic .h and .cpp files are included along with a README, a flow diagram, a video sample of the project and the assets folder that I have used (for the Tarantino-themed digital film archive). The project is based on the SGG (Simple Game Graphics) Library so you will need to follow the steps at the SGG/Getting started page (at https://cgaueb.github.io/sgg/pages.html ). After that, you may build a new empty project in Visual Studio and add at the solution folder the .h, the .cpp files and the assets folder.
